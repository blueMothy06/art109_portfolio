I've always thought blue and yellow were notoriously difficult colors to use in design, but I found that balancing them with white creates a great visual harmony. Overall, I made sure that none of the colors are overwhelming by making sure that the yellow was somewhat muted and the blue either darker or lighter based on where it was placed."> <img src="./assets/design/graphic1.png" alt="A graphic for the department's graduate programs fair. It is Thursday, October 20th, 2022 at Paseo de Cesar Cahvez."> </a>
          <a href="./assets/design/graphic2.png" data-lightbox="img" data-title="I had a similar approach as I did with my previous graphic, where I balanced blue and yellow with white. While there might be a lot of text on the poster, I've noticed that by separating the paragraphs into different colored sections, it allows for an easier read-through of the image."> <img src="./assets/design/graphic2.png" alt="An informational graphic for Clincial Mental Health Counseling."> </a>
