        Hey there, I'm Catherine! Sometimes I'm an anglerfish. Most of the time,
        however, I'm a person.
        <br>
        <br>
        I study digital media art at San Jose State University! Personally, I
        really like using technology with art. I intially majored in computer
        science, but found that sorting data by algorithms was terribly boring
        and not as engaging as I would've liked. Digital media art really forged the
        bridge between my artistic and technical sides and it's the kind of
        thing that inspires me, since there's so many directions I could take this.
        <br>
        <br>
        As an artist, I'm story-driven.

        In my spare time, I enjoy
        writing stories, developing narrative-driven games and driving myself insane
        from all the ideas I have yet to implement.
        <br>
