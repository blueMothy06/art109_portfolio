        Hey there, I'm Catherine! Sometimes I'm an anglerfish. Most of the time,
        however, I'm a person.
        <br>
        <br>
        I study digital media art at San Jose State University! Despite intially
        majoring in computer science, I found the subject to be dry and didn't
        fulfil me as creatively as I had hoped. See, I did enjoy the coding
        aspect of it, but when it was mostly about sorting data, that was where
        it lost me since there was a lot less room to mess around. Digital media
        art was a good fusion of what I liked, so here I am.
        <br>
        <br>
        In my spare time, I enjoy drawing, developing narrative-driven games and
        driving myself insane from all the ideas I have yet to implement.
        <br>
        <br>
