        data-title="Isobel, Isobel, Isobel...despite the romantic atmosphere,
        this woman is fated for tragedy, whether by her own hand or by her
        loved ones. <br><br>//<br><br> This piece was meant to feel like a long lost
        memory of something nostalgic and beautiful. There's a rose-tinted
        glasses effect going on, masking all the flaws. In the storyline, this
        perspective is from her wife, unaware of the secrets Isobel had."> <img

      is a character from Instagram @meijinn's Draw This In Your Style challenge!
      A very mysterious looking bird-man, as all bird-people should aspire for! <br><br>//<br><br>
      I was experimenting very heavily with the colors for this one and there's
      like ten 'final' versions of this drawing in my library. I don't think I've
      ever drawn something so heavily detailed before and it was a big learning
      experience."> <img src="./assets/illust/img2.webp" alt="Digital illustration of a man smoking a pipe. He is dressed in Asian-inspired fantasy clothing and the smoke has an orange outline."> </a>
      <a href="./assets/illust/img3.webp" data-lightbox="img"
        data-title="Three/Viktor, the protagonist of my upcoming horror game 'The Bodies of
        Henry Slater', is not the original. Nor is he a replacement for Henry Slater.
        No, as a failed experiment, he's caught in the limbo of trying to escape his
        fate or staying as the only living experiment left. <br><br>//<br><br>
        This was an unintentional drawing. I came into this illustration, with
        the mindset of creating a tense atmosphere with an unusually friendly
        stranger, but thanks to my love of warm colors, it comes off as something
        more casual instead.">

      <a href="./assets/illust/img4.webp" data-lightbox="img"
        data-title="The Watcher is a difficult topic, considering they're nothing more
        than boogeyman of stories at this point. However, a little somebody has been
        trying to track down these so-called 'Watchers' in hopes of eliminating them
        once and for all. <br><br>//<br><br> I'm planning to create a series of character
        profiles for my main cast and I figured 'why not go with the conspiracy board aesthetic
        with the red thread'? And then, I did it. I started shading with a more realistic
        style for this one, which is ironically canceled out by the photo glare and
        the amount of lighting effects I normally used for my drawings.">

      <a href="./assets/illust/img9.webp" data-lightbox="img" data-title="A birthday gift to one of my friends. As a special touch, I made sure to make it look like she's on the surface of the sun, seconds away from being burnt into a crisp."> <img

      art of Cassandra, a more reserved kind of person who likes to stay in the
      background, but will speak up if she thinks something is wrong. She's
      notoriously lazy, but can be sufficiently motivated by Bad Ideas and her shockingly poor
      taste in romantic partners.<br><br>//<br><br>I was thinking about creating
      a relaxing piece  of getting lost in doing an activity."> <img src="./assets/illust/img6.webp" alt="Digital illustration of a woman suspended midair and looking at her sketchbook as pages fly out of it."> </a>
      <a href="./assets/illust/img7.webp" data-lightbox="img" data-title="When Hades first came out, I was obsessed with the art style of the game. It's absolutely stunning and so stylistically distinct. As practice, I attempted to replicate that style and I like to think that I had a good attempt at it!"> <img src="./assets/illust/img7.webp" alt="Digital illustration of a woman sitting midair with a spear in one hand and a goblet in the next."> </a>
      <a href="./assets/illust/img8.webp" data-lightbox="img" data-title="Another Draw This In Your Style challenge, this time created by @stephattyy on instagram. At the time of this drawing, I was trying to figure out what my art style was or even is. This drawing brought a specific style to my current artwork now and I like to look back at this for inspiration."> <img src="./assets/illust/img8.webp" alt="Digital illustration of a woman posing."> </a>
      <a href="./assets/illust/img5.webp" data-lightbox="img" data-title="A lighting
      exercise, featuring my favorite unlucky character, Isaac! While running away
      trouble, he always manages to get into situations that are undoubtedly worse
      than the ones he was escaping from. He just wants a normal, stable life, but
      the world (meaning me) has other plans for him. <br><br>//<br><br> I was thinking
      of using a simpler drawing and letting it get affected by the different environments
      I tossed it into."> <img src="./assets/illust/img5.webp" alt="Digital illustration
